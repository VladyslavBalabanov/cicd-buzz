In this project I performed these six steps:
1. wrote buzz generator in Python;
2. added automated tests to the project;
3. pushed the project to the GitHub repository;
4. connected it to the Travis CI to run automated tests on every Git commit;
5. created a simple web app on base of buzz generator;
6. containerized my simple web app with docker and deployed it to Docker Hub;
